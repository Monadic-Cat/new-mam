      <h1>What is this?</h1>
      <p>
        This is not a normal website. This site is actually a character sheet manager for a game called
        <a href="https://www.magpiegames.com/masks/">Masks</a>!
        A so-called web "app". But the interactive content only works with JavaScript,
        which means one of two things happened:
        <ul>
          <li>The JavaScript that drives this web "app" failed to load</li>
          <li>You have JavaScript disabled</li>
          <!-- <li>Or maybe you're using a screen reader and I don't know how those work</li> -->
        </ul>
        In either of these cases, I sincerely apologize! I couldn't think of a way to make this work.
      </p>
      <h1>How do I make it work?</h1>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you have JavaScript disabled for some reason, it is possible you can just enable it and this
            web "app" will work! I understand if you aren't willing to do that.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the JavaScript failed to load due to some transient network error, you can just reload!
          </li>
          <li>
            If you're now offline, there is nothing to be done. I am sorry.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h1>What else can I do?</h1>
      <p>
        This web "app" is nonessential. There is nothing it does that cannot be done with a simple text editor.
        Here's a Markdown template:
        <pre>
          **Player Name:**
          **Character Name:**
          **Character Hero Name:**
          
          **Playbook:**
          **Powers/Abilities:**
          **-----------------------------------**
          **[Labels]**
          
          **Danger:**   -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
          **Freak:**    -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
          **Savior:**   -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
          **Superior:** -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
          **Mundane:**  -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
          
          **Conditions:** Afraid | Angry | Guilty | Hopeless | Insecure
          **Harm:** 0
          **Potential:** 0
        </pre>
        Just copy and paste that into a text editor and start playing!
        To help you get started, here's an example of a filled out sheet:
        <pre>
          **Player Name:** Monadic Cat
          **Character Name:** Ashley Korin Durst
          **Character Hero Name:** Dart

          **Playbook:** The Beacon
          **Powers/Abilities:** 
          **-----------------------------------**
          **[Labels]**

          **Danger:**   -2 | **-1** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
          **Freak:**    -2 | **-1** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
          **Savior:**   -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | **2** | 3
          **Superior:** -2 | -1 | **0** | 1 | 2 | 3
          **Mundane:**  -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | **2** | 3

          **Conditions:** Afraid | Angry | Guilty | Hopeless | Insecure
          **Harm:** 0
          **Potential:** 0
        </pre>
        There are actually lots of parts to the game that this web "app" doesn't help with at all,
        like tracking Moves, Relationships, and Influence.
        To do those, just add sections to your sheet like
        <pre>
          **[Influence]**
        </pre>
        and put the relevant information under them.
      </p>
      <h1>Can I read the source code?</h1>
      <p>
        If you're looking to read the source code for this web "app" before you run it,
        it's on <a href="https://github.com/Monadic-Cat/new-mam">GitHub</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have JavaScript disabled for GitHub as well, but <em>do</em> have Git,
        you can clone the code repository for local viewing with this command:
        <code>git clone https://github.com/Monadic-Cat/new-mam</code>
      </p>
    </div>
    <script>
      var cache = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cache'));
      var app = Elm.Main.init({
         node: document.getElementById('elm'),
         flags: cache
      });
      app.ports.cache.subscribe(function(data) {
         console.log(data);
         localStorage.setItem('cache', JSON.stringify(data));
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
